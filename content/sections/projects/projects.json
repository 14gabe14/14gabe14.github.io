      "description": "I collaborated with a team of six members to create EpiHealth, an innovative platform designed to predict epileptic seizures utilizing data from wearable devices. We employed tools like Pandas and Numpy for data preprocessing. Furthermore, we trained and implemented a cutting-edge LSTM architecture using Pytorch to predict seizures. We were honored with the Toronto Cohort‚Äôs Accelerator Award of the AI4Good Lab for the development of EpiHealth.",
